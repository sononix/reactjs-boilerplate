## React Boilerplate

Start developing React JS applications using gulp.

### Development
* Run `gulp`
* This starts a webserver on port 8888 http://localhost:8888 - this can be changed in the gulpfile

### Minify the code, ready for production
* Run `gulp deploy`

### Directory
* **build/**: Where your automatically builds to. This is where you launch your app in development
* **dist/**: Where the deployed code exists, ready for production
* **styles/**: Where you put your css files
* **specs/**: Where you put your test files
* **gulpfile**: Gulp configuration
